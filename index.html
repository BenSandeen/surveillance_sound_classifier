          <h1>Surveillance system sound classifier</h1>
<p>
    The goal of our project is to develop a system that can recognize and distinguish between threatening/threat-indicating
    and non-threatening/non-threat-indicating sounds.  This can be useful for surveillance systems, in order to help them
    effectively monitor their surroundings and report sounds that are often indicative of malfeasance.  This is important because it
    can help prevent a single security officer from falling into a stupor while staring at handfuls of monitors and potentially
    listening to sound feeds as well.  One can imagine that such a job, day after day, will almost invariably become dreadfully bore 
    to a worker, leading to reduced performance.  This is where our system should be able to contribute the most.
</p>

<p>
    We envision our system to act as a filter of sorts.  It constantly monitors incoming audio feeds and analyzes the sounds it
    detects.  Should the system detect a sound, say, a scream, that often indicates someone is in danger, the system will then alert
    a human security worker for further analysis and, should the detection indeed prove to be a real issue, determine the best
    course of action.
</p>

<p>
    This system uses machine learning to classify different sounds based on their features, such as spectral composition, attack
    (as in how quickly a single sound reaches its peak volume), and the MFCCs (Mel frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
</p>
<p>
    Here are several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_pitch_class_profiles">chromagrams</a> generated from each of
    our different sound source types (bangs and other manmade/artificial sounds, screams, singing, and birds/other natural
    sounds).  Each row consists of five randomly-selected sound files from the same category.

<p>
    Here are several MFCCs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum">Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients</a>),
    generated analogously to the chromagrams.  Note that the plots in the corresponding positions between the chromagrams and
    MFCCs are most likely NOT plots of the same sound file.

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page
    manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator.
    Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers
    intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can

        @mention</a>
    a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the
    contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath
