- within eecs352 environment, do all of the following:

$ git clone https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git

- navigate to the directory where the setup.py file is located (you must actually go here, you can't just run
the following command with a path to the setup.py file), and then run:

$ python setup.py install

- that should be all you need to do to install pybrain!
